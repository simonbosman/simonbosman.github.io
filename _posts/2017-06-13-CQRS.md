Command & Query and Responsibility Segregation
---

With the rise of "skynet", a new paradigm shift is evolving from monolythic software architectures to modular software 
architectures such as the microservice architecture.

In the good ol day [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/database/index.html) was the sheriff in town. 
we had ACID database transactions and live was wonderfull.

Change is coming [Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org) says.
But what about the [CAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem) theorem Cassandra?

Are you, just like me, a little stuck thinking in classic multi-tier architectures? 
Take this [journey](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj554200.aspx) to new, fresh and green grazinglands. 
It is an excellent starting point for a new way of thinking about modern software architectures.

I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
