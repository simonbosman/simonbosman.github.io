Program Proof
---

This year I've made an integration solution between Dutch Student Information Systems (SIS) and Microsoft Teams.
A lot of parallel computing is involved, hence I chose OCaml-inspired F# as the programming language of choice.

This was my first real project in F#. The company I work for and the customers are very happy with the result in terms of reliability and speed.

I have found this [beautiful book](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Samuel.Mimram/teaching/INF551/course.pdf) for more academic background and it's on my Christmas holiday reading list. 
Hope you will enjoy it too.
