Recursion theorem
---

While studying for the course [formal languages and automata](https://www.ou.nl/opleiding?sku=IB0802) I did use the excellent 
videos from [Shai Simonson](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7HjUNIdk93ThXvz2Oa_g30Jt3Owwm4HZ) as an extra help. 

In his [last video](https://youtu.be/e1cBQJ-dZ7E) he talks about the [recursion theorem](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~sheard/course/CS581/notes/RecursionTheorem.pdf) and gives an example in ... LOGO.

It took me down the memory lane, where I was programming as a little kid on an old [V-Tech Laser 310 computer](https://youtu.be/hY7_XhzETkM) in LOGO. 

Oh the good ol' days!

And now here I am, programming in LOGO again;-)
